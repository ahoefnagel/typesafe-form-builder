        <h1>Typesafe Form Builder</h1>
        <p>
            This is the hand-in for the 
            <a href="https://github.com/hogeschool/Software-Engineering-Minor/blob/master/Projects/project3%20-%20typesafe%20form%20builder.md">typesafe form builder assignment</a>
            of the software engineering minor at Hogeschool Rotterdam.
            There are two renderers for this form builder. One using Angular, and one using React.
            With the links below you can see these two renderers in action.
        </p>
        <h2>Live Demos</h2>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
            A form specification can be constructed using the FormBuilder object, 
            and the functions entity, select, child and children.
            The implemented type safety combined with the Typescript autocomplete
            features in Visual Studio Code allow the developer to quickly setup
            a form specification.
        </p>
        <video src="./media/form-builder-example.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>
            In Visual Studio Code we can now hover over the specification property
            of the formbuilder, to see that the type of the specification has been
            infered from the given input.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally we can give this specification object to either the Angular or 
            React render component.
            For Angular, the &lt;lib-form&gt; component has an input attribute
            "specification" that takes the form builder's specification object 
            as input.

        <h2>Project Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The project consists of three packages.
            Each contained in a folder in the root of the repository.
            First, the <b>typesafe-form-builder</b> package, which contains all
            functions and interfaces needed to build a form specification
            in a type safe way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The type-safe-formbuilder package is used as a dependency by the
            <b>angular-form-builder</b> and <b>react-form-builder</b> packages.
            Both of these contain components to render the specification, and
            handle user input.
