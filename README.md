# typesafe-form-builder - ðŸ”§ Bob The Form Builder ðŸ”¨
Building forms with complete typesafety. 

## Initializing the project
The initialization of the three sub-projects that are used to create the form builder are quite straight forward. Just as you normally would, you use `npm install` to install all the required packages. But this can be done in the root folder of the project.  
The install script has been changed by installing the packages that are required for each sub-project. 

## Building the project
After the packages of a sub-project have been downloaded, the `postinstall` script will be ran. This script will build the project with the specifications that have been described in the relevant `tsconfig.json` files.
